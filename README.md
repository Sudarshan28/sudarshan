# EXPERIMENT-1 GITHUB REPOSITORY AND PAGES

In this experiment, I created a Github repository, added a simple static webpage, worked with branches to update and merge changes, and finally hosted the site using Github pages. The project demonstrates basic version control with Git and publishing a website directly from a Github repository.
